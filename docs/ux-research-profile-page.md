```
Header User Icon → Click → Dropdown Menu → "Profile" Option → Profile Page
```

### Profile Management Flow
```
Profile Page → Edit Mode → Make Changes → Validation → Save → Confirmation → Updated Profile
```

### Password Change Flow
```
Profile Page → Security Section → Change Password → Current Password → New Password → Confirm → Save → Email Confirmation
```

### Error Recovery Flow
```
Validation Error → Clear Error Message → Highlight Field → Provide Guidance → Allow Retry
```

---

## 4. Content Strategy

### Page Title and Navigation
- **Primary Heading**: "Mi Perfil" (keeping Spanish consistency)
- **Breadcrumb**: Dashboard > Mi Perfil
- **Page Description**: "Gestiona tu información personal y configuración de cuenta"

### Information Architecture
```
Profile Page Layout:
├── Profile Header (Name, Role, Avatar Area)
├── Personal Information Section
│   ├── Basic Details (Name, Email)
│   └── Edit Form (Collapsible)
├── Role & Permissions Section
│   ├── Current Role Badge
│   └── Permissions Overview
├── Security Section
│   ├── Password Management
│   └── Security Status
└── Activity Section (Optional)
    ├── Recent Activity
    └── Account Statistics
```

### Microcopy Guidelines
- **Buttons**: "Editar Perfil", "Guardar Cambios", "Cancelar", "Cambiar Contraseña"
- **Success Messages**: "✨ Perfil actualizado exitosamente"
- **Error Messages**: "❌ Error al actualizar. Intenta nuevamente"
- **Placeholders**: "Ingresa tu nombre", "Confirma tu contraseña actual"

## 5. Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection Requirements
1. **Field-Level Security**
   - Only show email if user has permission
   - Mask sensitive information appropriately
   - Validate all inputs server-side

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Admins can edit all profile fields
   - Supervisors and Inspectors can only edit basic personal info
   - Role changes require admin approval

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all profile changes
   - Track who made changes and when
   - Maintain change history for compliance

4. **Password Security**
   - Enforce strong password requirements
   - Require current password for changes
   - Send email notifications for security changes

### Privacy Settings
- Users control visibility of their information
- Opt-in for activity tracking
- Clear data retention policies

## 6. Design System Integration

### Glassmorphism Implementation
- **Profile Cards**: Use glass-card-magical class
- **Form Inputs**: Apply form-input-magical styling
- **Buttons**: Utilize btn-glass-sparkle for primary actions
- **Role Badges**: Custom glass badges with role-specific colors

### Magical Interactions
- **Save Animation**: Sparkle effect on successful save
- **Form Focus**: Subtle glow on input focus
- **Role Badge Hover**: Gentle float animation
- **Loading States**: Magical spinner during updates

### Color Coding by Role
- **Admin**: Gold/amber accents (#F59E0B)
- **Supervisor**: Blue accents (#3B82F6)  
- **Inspector**: Green accents (#10B981)

## 7. Success Metrics & KPIs

### Primary Metrics
1. **Profile Completion Rate**: % of users with complete profiles
2. **Edit Success Rate**: % of successful profile updates
3. **Password Change Frequency**: Monthly password updates
4. **Error Rate**: % of failed profile update attempts

### User Experience Metrics
1. **Time to Complete Profile**: Average time to fill required fields
2. **Navigation Efficiency**: Clicks to reach profile page
3. **Form Abandonment Rate**: % of users who start but don't finish edits
4. **Help/Support Requests**: Profile-related support tickets

### Business Impact Metrics
1. **User Adoption**: % of active users who access their profile
2. **Security Compliance**: % of users with updated passwords
3. **Data Quality**: % of profiles with complete information
4. **User Satisfaction**: Profile page satisfaction scores

### Analytics Implementation
```javascript
// Track profile page visits
analytics.track('Profile Page Viewed', {
  user_role: userRole,
  profile_completion: completionPercentage
})

// Track profile updates
analytics.track('Profile Updated', {
  fields_changed: ['first_name', 'last_name'],
  user_role: userRole,
  update_duration: timeSpent
})
```

## 8. Technical Considerations

### API Endpoints Needed
```typescript
// Profile management
GET /api/profiles/current - Get current user profile
PUT /api/profiles/current - Update current user profile
POST /api/auth/change-password - Change password

// Activity tracking
GET /api/profiles/activity - Get user activity summary
```

### Form Validation Rules
```typescript
interface ProfileValidation {
  first_name: {
    required: true,
    minLength: 2,
    maxLength: 50,
    pattern: /^[a-zA-ZáéíóúñÑ\s]+$/
  },
  last_name: {
    required: true,
    minLength: 2,
    maxLength: 50,
    pattern: /^[a-zA-ZáéíóúñÑ\s]+$/
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful fallbacks for data loading failures
- Offline capability for viewing profile
- Retry mechanisms for failed updates
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions

## 9. Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG Compliance
- **Level AA**: Minimum contrast ratios for glassmorphism elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactions
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators throughout the form

### Inclusive Design
- **Language Support**: RTL text support preparation
- **Text Scaling**: Responsive design for 200% zoom
- **Motion Preferences**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
- **Color Independence**: Don't rely solely on color for role indication

## 10. Implementation Recommendations

### Development Phase Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Basic profile display and edit functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Security features and role management
3. **Phase 3**: Activity tracking and preferences
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and optimizations

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Form validation and data processing
2. **Integration Tests**: API interactions and state management
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Automated and manual accessibility testing
5. **User Testing**: 5-user moderated testing sessions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load non-critical profile sections
- Optimize image uploads for profile pictures
- Cache profile data appropriately
- Minimize API calls during form interactions

## Next Steps for UI Design

Based on this research, the UI designer should focus on:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Create clear information sections with appropriate spacing
2. **Form Design**: Design intuitive edit modes with clear state transitions
3. **Role Visualization**: Develop distinctive but cohesive role indicators
4. **Micro-interactions**: Design delightful feedback for all user actions
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure excellent mobile experience for field workers
6. **Error States**: Design helpful and non-intimidating error messaging

The profile page should feel like a natural extension of the existing glassmorphism design while providing a sense of personal ownership and control for users.
