   - Screen transitions: Slide animations between form steps
   - Loading states: Skeleton screens for data fetching
   - Status changes: Color transitions for badge updates
   - Mobile gestures: Swipe navigation support
   - Feedback: Subtle vibrations for important actions

2. Define interaction states:
   - Loading, error, success states for all components
