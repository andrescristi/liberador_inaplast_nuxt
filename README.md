### Creating Users

#### Method 1: Admin Panel (Recommended)
Once you have an admin user, you can create new users through the admin interface:
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to "Administración" in the navigation menu
3. Click "Crear Usuario" 
4. Fill in user details and assign a role
5. The new user will receive an email confirmation automatically

#### Method 2: Supabase Dashboard (Initial Setup)
For creating your first admin user, use the Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Users
3. Click "Add user" 
4. Enter email and password (e.g., `admin@example.com` / `123456`)
5. In the Database > Profiles table, update the user's role to 'Admin'

**Test Credentials**: Create an admin user with `admin@example.com` and password `123456` for testing.

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev             # Start development server
pnpm build           # Build for production
pnpm generate        # Generate static site
pnpm preview         # Preview production build
pnpm lint            # Run ESLint to check code quality
pnpm lint:fix        # Automatically fix ESLint issues
```

### Custom UI Component System

This project uses a custom component system built with TailwindCSS and Headless UI:

- **BaseButton**: Multi-variant button (solid, outline, ghost, link) with loading states
- **BaseCard**: Flexible card with header, body, and footer slots
- **BaseInput**: Form input with validation states and icon support
- **BaseModal**: Modal dialogs with smooth transitions
- **BaseAlert**: Notification alerts with multiple variants
- **BaseDropdown**: Dropdown menus with keyboard navigation
- **BaseBadge**: Status badges with color variants
- **BaseTable**: Data tables with selection support
- **Toast System**: Global notification management

All components are auto-imported and include full TypeScript support.

### Code Quality & Linting

This project maintains high code quality standards with:

- **ESLint Configuration**: Comprehensive rules for Vue.js, TypeScript, and Nuxt.js
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with proper prop definitions
- **Component Prop Types**: Optimized for @nuxt/icon compatibility with Boxicons
- **Clean Code Standards**: Automated linting with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm lint:fix`
- **Zero ESLint Errors**: Comprehensive codebase cleanup completed across all pages
- **Dead Code Elimination**: Removed unused variables, functions, and commented-out code
- **Shared Utilities**: Created reusable formatting functions to eliminate code duplication
- **Production Ready**: All pages optimized for maintainability and performance

### CSS Architecture & Organization

The project uses a modular CSS architecture for maintainability and performance:

- **Modular Structure**: Page-specific CSS files separated from global styles
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Common animations and utilities consolidated in `main.css`
- **Global Optimizations**: Universal transitions, reduced-motion preferences, and accessibility
- **Performance Focused**: Minimized CSS redundancy and optimized loading
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns between global and component-specific styles

**CSS Files:**
- `main.css` - Global styles, common animations (`fade-in-up`), accessibility features
- `dashboard.css` - Dashboard metrics animations and hover effects
- `profile.css` - Profile page micro-interactions and delightful animations
- `mobile-optimizations.css` - Mobile-first responsive design and touch optimizations

### Authentication Flow

1. **Route Protection**: All routes use the `auth` middleware
2. **Login Required**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/login`
3. **Clean Auth Experience**: Navigation is hidden on login/auth pages for cleaner UX
4. **Session Persistence**: Supabase handles session management automatically
5. **Profile Access**: Users can access their profile page via the navigation menu
6. **Logout**: Available through the user menu in the navigation

### Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles with role-based access control
- `user_activity_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail for all user management actions
- `orders` - Product release records with quality control data
- `order_items` - Individual items and test results within releases

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- **Admin**: Full system access including user management
- **Supervisor**: Can manage orders and view all data
- **Inspector**: Can create and manage assigned orders

See `supabase/migrations/` for complete schema definitions and security policies.

## Deployment

### Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment platform:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm build

# The .output directory contains the built application
# Deploy the .output directory to your hosting platform
```

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication Required**: All routes are protected by default
- **Row Level Security**: Database tables use RLS policies
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling via Supabase Auth
